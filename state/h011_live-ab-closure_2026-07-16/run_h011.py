"""H_011 live-ab-closure — STAGE A: certify the interventional instrument with NO LLM.

Stage A runs scripted policies in the micro-tenant world and proves the instrument
SEPARATES CHANNEL from CLOSURE before any LLM touches summer (the H_009 two-INVALID
lesson: certify the plants first). Three plants must land exactly:
  P-LIVE  (contingent policy, coupled env)  -> ANCHOR       (LV-W pass, LV-C pass)
  P-OPEN  (same actions SHUFFLED = a tape,   -> CHANNEL-ONLY (LV-W pass, LV-C FAIL):
           non-contingent, coupled env)          actions have effects but their ORDER
                                                 (contingency) leaves no fingerprint
  P-DEAD  (contingent policy, NULL env)      -> REFUSED      (LV-W fail: no action channel)

- LV-W (channel): does the executed action predict the next observation beyond obs-state
  and beyond a marginal-matched WRONG action? Certified H_009'/H_010 LOO k-NN, arms
  BASE / FULL / SHUF (a distAction first-axis remap of the shared obs-distance).
- LV-C (closure = the anchor): the closed episode's obs-trajectory must differ from
  marginal-matched YOKED GHOSTS (its own actions PERMUTED, same (seed,t) noise) MORE than
  the ghosts differ from each other — Watson's yoked control, per 50-tick block.

Stage B (the local LLM brain on summer) reuses run_episode()/the arms verbatim and fires
ONLY on a clean stage A. Deterministic, stdlib only, $0. Run:
