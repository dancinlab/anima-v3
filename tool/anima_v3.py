"""anima_v3 — shared runnable harness for HYPOTHESES hypothesis cards.

Deterministic, dependency-free (stdlib only) primitives for the anima-v3 problem.
HYPOTHESES cards reference these functions from their per-hypothesis run scripts
under `state/<hX>/` (shared machinery lives in repo-root `tool/`, per-hypothesis
runs live in `state/`).

Every function is a closed-form public relation — no fitting, no hidden constants
beyond documented defaults. All inputs are explicit so a card's falsifiers can be
evaluated against the returned numbers.

Scope note: this module owns the ESTIMATORS, not the experiment. A card's run
script extracts raw quantities (seam activations, CE values, byte counts) from
whatever rig produced them and passes them here; the estimator that turns those
into a gate verdict is pre-registered, deterministic, and identical across runs.
That separation is what makes two runs comparable at all.

The two gates below are non-negotiable for every family
(`ARCHITECTURE.json` -> `verification.inherited-gates`) — they are the exact
measurements whose absence killed v1:

  * L1 effective-rank check — does the mechanism's seam carry more than one bit?
    (v1's emit-seam measured rank-1: it visited 2 of 4 codes and the only bit it
    ever learned was the gate's own existence.)
  * L2 ablation check — cut the channel; does CE actually move? (v1's OMEGA moved
    0.0009 nats = decoration.)
